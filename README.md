# Automata
Create clusters for distributed software

Automata does this by Generate OS iso's and fire them up on hosts (kvm or redfish)

1) Factory your media ,one for each node in cluster.  

iso_factory.sh <osversion> <nodes> <nodename> <domain>  

For example , to create 4 isos with hostnames {spark1.x14.se, spark2.x14.se, spark3.x14.se}  
prompt>iso_create.sh fedora_41 4 spark x14.se  

2) Initate your hosts   (DISCLAIMER WARNING WILL DESTROY / FORMAT / DELETE your hosts)  
kvm_initate.sh <osversion> <nodes> <nodename> <domain>  
redfish_initiate.sh <osversion> <nodes> <nodename> <domain>  


3) Fire up your cluster by installing iso's on hosts  

kvm_cluster.sh <osversion> <nodes> <nodename> <domain>   
redfish_cluster.sh <osversion> <nodes> <nodename> <domain>  

a small cluster json vill be created with IP'setc..  

4) Use your cluster  
Its up and running and you have an cluster.json with ip's etc
